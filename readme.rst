About
-----
**KRONOS Timeslots** is a web based application where carriers can book 
timeslots for loading. KRONOS has several stations where customers can fetch
their products and each of which has different loading times.

Beeing a customer, one will be assigned one or more stations and so be able to
book appropiate timeslots for each station individual. Having a reserved 
timeslot for loading makes planing much easier.

**KRONOS Timeslots** has been developed based on the web framework 
Django_.
